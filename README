This is a set of win32 libraries needed for full functionality, in binary
form.  You can grab their sources from their respective homepages:
* http://www.zlib.net/
* http://bzip.org/
* http://tukaani.org/xz/

All of these come with extremely permissive licenses, allowing distribution
of sourceless binaries.  I'm thus skipping copying the sources, as building
win32 blobs from them is not straightforward anyway.  The blobs provided
here are their upstream official builds.  Yes, shipping such blobs is an
anathema for a proper Free Software zealot, but this is only par for
Windows...
